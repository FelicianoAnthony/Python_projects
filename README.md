# My Portfolio!
I thought I'd showcase my work in Python and learn how to use git at the same time. Turns out I have way more code than I thought I did! Here's how it's organized:

# HBNL_tools
A collection of modules & tools I've developed while working at the [Henri Begleiter Neurodynamics Laboratory](http://www.downstate.edu/hbnl/) in Brooklyn.  
They parse & review electrical brain wave & neuropsychological data, build intuitive query functions for lab database spanning 30+ years of research data, & clean data for statistical analysis.   

### Packages used: pandas, bokeh, PyMongo, numpy, subprocess, re, itertools, collections, os, glob...

# Django

A simple website created with Django that can be hosted on your local machine

# Machine Learning 

A simple machine learning model to predict total number of runs scored across all Major League Baseball Teams in a given year 

# Staging

Current projects being worked on

# Web scraping
Project that involved building a web scraper to download MLB statistics from the [”Team Batting tables”](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYM/2017.shtml) for any combination of teams and seasons and creating visualizations from scraped data 

### Packages used: BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, collections, bokeh...

# Twitter Tools
**Streaming API**: Search twitter for 'live' tweets (i.e. tweets just tweeted) and stores tweet text, location, friends count, etc. into SQL DB.  
	     
### Packages used: tweepy, pandas, sqlite3, json... 


# To view plots in notebooks: 

Bokeh uses Dynamic JS & github doesn't yet support it so...
[go here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) & paste the url of the notebook you want to view
