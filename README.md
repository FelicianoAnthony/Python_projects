# My Portfolio!
I thought I'd showcase my work in Python and learn git at the same time.  Turns out I have way more code than I thought I did.
Here's how it's organized: 

# HBNL_tools 
Is a folder of tools I've developed to analyze Event-Related Potential (brain wave) data and neuropsychological data.  
Pandas is your friend.

# Web scraping
For a project with a friend that involved scraping html tables titled "Team Batting" from http://www.baseball-reference.com done
the easy way (pd.read_html) and the hard way(bs4).  

# Tweepy 
Is a folder of tools I've developed using Twitter's REST API to programatically manage an account.  
Contains functions to mass unfollow users, follow new users by tweet text/hashtag/location/etc., and post tweets from 
a text file at fixed intervals.  Example of Twitter's Streaming API to collect "live tweets" as they happen.
